# Setup Guide
This repository provides installation links and setup guides for essential computational tools used in first-principles simulations, specifically Quantum ESPRESSO (QE), XCrySDen, and pseudopotentials. These tools are widely used for electronic structure calculations, visualization, and material simulations.
