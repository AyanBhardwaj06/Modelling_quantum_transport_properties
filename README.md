# Modelling_quantum_transport_properties
This repository contains scripts and data related to my research project under Prof. Madhav Ranganathan at IIT Kanpur. The project focuses on modelling 2D Silicene surface structure using quantum chemistry methods. It includes computational models, input files, and scripts for quantum simulations, primarily utilizing Quantum ESPRESSO.
