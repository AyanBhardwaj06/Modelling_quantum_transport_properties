# Overview
This repository contains input and output files for Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) simulations, along with visualizations and analysis of structural and energy calculations. The data is essential for understanding the relationship between energy and structural dimensions, as well as for visualizing atomic configurations. 
 # Quantum ESPRESSO Input Files
.in files containing SCF and relaxation calculation parameters.
 Configurations for different structural dimensions.
# Quantum ESPRESSO Output Files
Corresponding .out files capturing energy calculations and convergence results.
Log files for troubleshooting and verification of simulation accuracy.
# XCrySDen Structural Visualizations
.xsf or .xyz files for visualizing atomic structures.
Ready-to-use files for loading into XCrySDen.

The best-optimized structure has been drawn for visualization.
# Results
The optimized bond length was found to be 3.87 Ã…, which is consistent with previous findings.
